        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>In this strategy game, players bid on countries, battle for control, and manage their resources, including money and military power (MP), to conquer the world. The goal is to acquire as many countries as possible while using strategy, diplomacy, and resources wisely.</p>

        <h2>Game Setup</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Players: 4 players, each starting with 3 billion dollars.</li>
            <li>Maximum MP: Each player can have a maximum of 125 MP (military power).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Special Conditions</h2>
        <h3>Recovering Countries</h3>
        <p>Definition: Recovering countries are countries that are in the process of recovering from negative events (like war, economic collapse, etc.).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mark the recovery time by placing tokens (or checker pieces) on the country card. Recovery time varies depending on the intensity of the event.</li>
            <li>If a player attacks a recovering country, the recovering country loses 15 MP in the battle.</li>
            <li>Recovering countries cannot attack or give payouts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Auction</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Countries are revealed one at a time and auctioned off to the players.</li>
            <li>If no one bids for a country, its price is halved and the auction continues until the country is bought.</li>
            <li>Selling Countries: Players can sell countries to other players or to the bank, but they can't buy it back.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Attacking</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Players may attack as many countries as they like per turn if they meet the requirements.</li>
            <li>To attack, answer 1 trivia question or pay 10 million dollars.</li>
            <li>Answer 2 trivia questions for island nations or pay 15 million dollars.</li>
            <li>If the attacker is an island nation, they must answer 1 trivia question correctly or pay 10 million dollars if attacking another island nation.</li>
            <li>The country you attack must be bordering your country.</li>
            <li>Starting the Battle: Any player asks a trivia question to the defender and attacker.</li>
            <li>The first player to answer correctly gains a +10 MP bonus.</li>
            <li>Incorrect answers result in a -5 MP penalty.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Special Actions During Battle</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Diplomatic Solution: The attacker can propose a diplomatic solution, where the defender agrees to end the battle. The attacker pays a 10 million dollar fee and leaves the country.</li>
            <li>Calling for Resources: The attacker can request resources from their other countries or from other players. Each resource received adds +5 MP, but the country sending resources goes into recovery for 1 turn.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Battle Outcome</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If the Attacker Wins:
                <ul>
                    <li>The attacker collects the bid price of the country and gains control of the country card.</li>
                    <li>The defender’s country goes into recovery for 3 turns.</li>
                    <li>Recovery time for the attacking country is calculated based on the difference in MP:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Win by < 15 MP: 3 turns recovery.</li>
                        <li>Win by < 30 MP: 2 turns recovery.</li>
                        <li>Win by < 100 MP: 1 turn recovery.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>If the Defender Wins:
                <ul>
                    <li>The attacker must pay 10 million to the defender and 10 million to the bank.</li>
                    <li>Both players keep their countries.</li>
                    <li>Both countries go into recovery for 2 turns.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Payout</h2>
        <p>At the end of each player's turn, they receive money for each country they own, excluding recovering countries.</p>
        <p><strong>Payout Example:</strong> If a player owns 10 countries, but 2 of them are recovering, they will receive 8 million dollars (1 million per country).</p>

        <h2>Special Cards</h2>
        <p>Limited Edition! There are only 16 special cards available in the game! One-time use per game!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Purchasing Special Cards: Players can buy a special card for 25 million dollars each. Players also receive Special cards if they conquer a country.</li>
            <li>Special Cards: These cards offer powerful one-time effects that can be used during the game, but remember—once used, they’re gone!</li>
        </ul>
